## What is it?

***

Food is essential for our lives!   
If you want to know your food better you can just take a photo of  the it and submit to your Your Nutrition Bro.
It will automatically process your image and prints out ingredients list as well as nutrition set.

## File Structure

***

**./data:**  
Folder "data" has the text information from dataset [ingredient101](http://www.ub.edu/cvub/ingredients101/)  
You can download corresponding images [food101](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41)

**./test_img:**  
This folder contains test images. You can also add your own images.     

**./nutribro_model**   
This folder contains files for model.        

**./suply**  
This folder contains codes for vocabulary builder, data loader, dataset sampler and some helper functions.  

**./root**:  
[train.py](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/train.py): train the model  
[test.py](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/test.py): test the model's accuracy and F1 scores <br>
[test.ipynb](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/test.ipynb): test the model, process the image in test_img folder, and print ingredients list and nutrition list.

Results from the preprocess (regenerated by running [build_vocab.py](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/suply/train.py)): <br>
[datatest.pkl](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/datatest.pkl)/[datatrain.pkl](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/datatrain.pkl) /[dataval.pkl](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/dataval.pkl): processed data (needed when training the model)  
[vocab_ingrs.pkl](https://github.com/yq605879396/Your-NutritionBro/blob/main/vocab_ingrs.pkl): generated vocabulary (needed when training or testing the model) 

## Installation
```python
conda install pytorch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## How to use it?

***

### To train the model:  
In root directory,
```python
python train.py
```

Or you can download sample pretrained model here:  
[ResNet18 + 6 epoch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ycciUE9VthbnHPgRc9iLLZnPvVg2pvLO/view?usp=sharing)  


### To Test the model:  
To obtain accuracy and F1 scores, in root directory run: 
```python
python test.py
``` 
To obtain ingredients list and nutrition list run test.ipynb
